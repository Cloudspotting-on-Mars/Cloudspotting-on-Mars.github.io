title: Cloudspotting on Mars: Shapes launched, Armin in the Maldives
---

Hi! Thank you all for participating in the Cloudspotting on Mars citizen science project. On October 29, 2024, we launched a new branch of the project that runs in parallel to the identification of clouds in limb imagery of the Mars Climate Sounder on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. In [Cloudspotting on Mars: Shapes](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/matteocrismani/cloudspotting-on-mars-shapes), participants have the opportunity to map clouds and mark their types in imagery of the Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph on the MAVEN orbiter. Please check it out.

On a different note, I will be visiting the islands of Soneva Fushi and Soneva Jani in the Maldives from December 13-25, 2024. I will be hosting stargazing sessions with the telescopes located on the islands. The focus will be the planets of Mars and Venus, which both should be well visible at this time. I will be introducing the Cloudspotting on Mars citizen science project and share stories about the science and exploration of the planets.
